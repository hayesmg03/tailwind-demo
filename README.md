This is a simple website I made to learn TailwindCSS. I chose to imitate the official Tailwind website to learn good design practices. I styled it using almost entirely Tailwind classes to force myself to learn attributes I otherwise would have used plain CSS for. Much of what you see is guided by the layout of the official website. I tried to incorporate as many elements and attributes that were unfamiliar to me while retaining the sleek feel of the original website.
